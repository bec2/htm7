# DOOM: HTM7 - Captain TW's Revenge
Hack the Midlands 7.0 


This is our first ever DOOM custom content. As such, it kinda sucks.

Anyway, all you need to do to play this is:
- Have the original DOOM game already on your system, as well as your source port (this was made for GZDoom so we aren't sure if others will work).
- Download only the launchable wad file from this repo.
- Bob's your uncle.

Aaron let us do this, promise.
